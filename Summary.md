# Educational Dashboard System - Project Summary

## Project Overview

You'll be creating an **Educational Dashboard System** that helps schools or educational organizations manage their curriculum, teachers, and learning content. This project will build on your existing knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, and React while introducing you to full-stack web development concepts.

## The Big Picture

This system has two main user roles:
- **Super Admin**: Manages the overall system organization
- **Teachers**: Create and manage educational content

The dashboard will organize educational content in a structured way:
1. **Categories** can be organized hierarchically (with parent-child relationships)
2. **Subjects** belong to one or more categories
3. **Teachers** are assigned to teach specific subjects
4. For each subject, teachers create **Learning Paths** (curriculums)
5. Learning Paths contain **Lessons** and **Quizzes**

## Key Features You'll Implement

### For Admin Users
- Create and manage nested categories
- Add subjects and assign them to categories
- Add teacher accounts and assign subjects to teachers
- View system overview and management reports

### For Teacher Users
- Manage assigned subjects
- Create learning paths with multiple versions/editions
- Create lessons with rich text content
- Build quizzes with different question types
- Organize content in a structured curriculum

## Technologies You'll Use
You are free to use any tech stack you're comfortable with.

## Learning Opportunities

This project will help you develop skills in:
1. **React Component Development** - Building reusable UI components
2. **State Management** - Handling application data
3. **API Integration** - Connecting frontend to backend
4. **Authentication & Authorization** - Implementing secure user access
5. **Form Handling** - Creating and validating complex forms
6. **Data Relationships** - Managing complex data relationships
7. **Database Design** - Working with relational data models

## Development Approach

An incremental approach is the best way to learn:

1. **Start with the core structure**:
   - Set up the project
   - Implement authentication
   - Create the basic dashboard layout

2. **Build the admin features**:
   - Category management
   - Subject management
   - Teacher account management

3. **Develop teacher features**:
   - Learning path creation
   - Lesson editor
   - Quiz builder

4. **Add advanced features (OPTIONAL)**:
   - Content previews
   - Version control for learning paths
   - Search functionality

## Resources Provided

To help you get started, we've provided:
- A comprehensive database schema (in dbdiagram.io format)
- UI design guidelines
- API endpoint specifications
- Project development plan

## How will this help you in the job market:

This project represents a real-world application that combines database design, backend API development, and frontend UI implementationâ€”all skills that are highly valuable in web development. 

If you manage to make this app, it will open up a whole world of opportunities in Web & App Development Roles
  - Full-Stack Web/App Developer
  - Frontend Developer (React)
  - Backend Developer (Node.js / Laravel / Django, etc.) depending on your chosen stacks
  - Junior Web/App Developer
  - Software Developer Intern
  - REST API Developer
    
## After you've read this summary
   - You can go to the [Project's](https://github.com/mouradsme/siine-lman) main github repo.
   - Start by reading the Project Plan where I provided a detailed plan on how to develop this app in an incremental approach.
   - It would be best to do the development on your own (you can rely on the Internet/Coding AIs too, but make sure you understand what you are implementing).
   - Do not hesitate to ask for help in case you are stuck.
   - In order to get a taste of how most remote programming jobs are managed, I highly recommend you use a task management app like clockify or even better and simpler: Google Sheets/Excel.

Good luck!
